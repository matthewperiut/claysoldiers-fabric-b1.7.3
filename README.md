# Clay Soldiers v3 b1.7.3 written for STAPI 2.0-pre2 (be5f057) on babric

## Info
The recreation of https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1275357-1-0-0-clay-soldiers-classic entirely on STAPI, should have complete parity in functionality, although worlds with jarmod will not convert items/entities (i don't think).
